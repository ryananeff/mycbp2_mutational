This repository includes code for the manuscript *Dysfunction of Ubiquitin Protein Ligase MYCBP2 Leads to Cell Resilience in Human Breast Cancers*. This includes three sets of experiments

1. Analyses performed on TCGA-BRCA data leading to the discovery of MYCBP2 perturbations
2. Flow cytometry of apoptosis and cell cycle experiments in MCF10A cells treated with MycBP2 siRNA (knockdown) and with or without cisplatin, a DNA-damage inducing agent
3. Bulk RNA-sequencing of MCF10A cells treated with MycBP2 siRNA (knockdown) and with or without cisplatin
